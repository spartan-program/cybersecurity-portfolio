# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Portfolio by Austin

Welcome to my Cybersecurity Portfolio. This repository is designed to showcase my hands-on skills, tool proficiency, and practical understanding of key cybersecurity concepts across both SOC (Security Operations Center) and GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance) domains.

## 🔍 Purpose

This repo serves as **evidence of my applied cybersecurity capabilities**. It includes walkthroughs, configurations, detection engineering exercises, risk assessments, and more—demonstrating my use of industry-relevant tools, platforms, and frameworks.

## 🧰 Tools & Frameworks Used

- **SIEMs** (e.g., Splunk, Elastic)
- **EDR Platforms** (e.g., CrowdStrike, Microsoft Defender)
- **Threat Intelligence** (e.g., MISP, VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB)
- **Vulnerability Scanning** (e.g., Nessus Essentials, OpenVAS)
- **Risk Management** (e.g., NIST RMF, ISO 27001)
- **Lab Environments** (e.g., TryHackMe, Hack The Box, DetectionLab)

## 📂 Repo Structure

- `SOC_Labs/` – Hands-on blue team exercises (THM, detections, log analysis)
- `GRC_Artifacts/` – Policy templates, risk assessments, compliance documentation
- `Projects/` – End-to-end case studies or custom labs
- `Writeups/` – Documentation and analysis of completed labs and challenges

## 📌 Focus Areas

- Threat detection and analysis  
- Log correlation and investigation  
- Security framework application  
- Risk evaluation and documentation  
- Tool configuration and workflow development  

## 📈 Goals

- Demonstrate capability in using real-world cybersecurity tools
- Provide practical, verifiable work samples to potential employers
- Track my development as I transition from semiconductor manufacturing into cybersecurity
